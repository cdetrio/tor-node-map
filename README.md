See it here: [http://cdetrio.github.io/tor-node-map/](http://cdetrio.github.io/tor-node-map/)


Uses tor relay information from [https://onionoo.torproject.org/](https://onionoo.torproject.org/). Plots relay nodes as bubbles (circles) with area proportional to their observed bandwidth. The bubbles are plotted on a [kinetic.js](http://kineticjs.com/) canvas, overlayed on top of a [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) map. I did it this way (kinetic/d3 mashup) for better performance. On my machine, panning/zooming more than a few hundred d3 svg elements is too slow. But it can comfortably handle a few thousand canvas sprites. Kineticjs provides event handlers on canvas sprites, d3 does not. Firefox needs an offsetX/Y event property kludge, so relay selection works a little bit better in Chrome.

One issue to be fixed is when multiple relays have the same geoip latitude/longitude coordinates. Where this happens, you will see lots of white as several bubbles of different sizes are placed at the exact same spot (each bubble has a thin white outline stroke). I'm not yet sure how to deal with this.

There's also a group of bubbles in the top-left (0,0), these are relays with ip addresses not in the geoip database.

To fetch latest relay details from onionoo: `wget https://onionoo.torproject.org/details?type=relay -O onionoo-relay-details.json`

To run a local webserver: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

Incentive for Tor Relays - proof-of-relay / proof-of-bandwidth
------
Currently, Tor relay bandwidths are [estimated by active measurements](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relay), performed by a set of "bandwidth authorities" (bwauths). The bandwidth authorities vote to form a "consensus bandwidth" (listed as "consensus_weight" in onionoo) value for a relay.

[LIRA](http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/ndss13-lira.pdf) is an incentive scheme for Tor relays - think of it as "TorCoin". LIRA proposes using an opportunistic [decentralized bandwidth measurement](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5464), namely [EigenSpeed](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/iptps09/tech/full_papers/snader/snader.pdf), instead of active measurements by bandwidth authorities. In a decentralized EigenSpeed measurement, each node would communicate to others its estimate of other nodes' bandwidths. The result would be each node maintaining its own large sparse [EigenTrust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EigenTrust)-like matrix.
